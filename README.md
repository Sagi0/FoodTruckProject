# Food Truck Project

## Description
This software project is a Food Truck software that stores user input information about Food Trucks. Then this software uses, creates a menu, formulates, and displays that information to show: 
- Name
- Food Type
- Rating
- Rating Average

This project was done during my second week of my ever so fabulous Java full stack Boot Camp cohort. This project was so fun and *difficult*, that I'd like to share it. 

## Technologies Used
- Google, **Google**, *Google*
- Java
- Git/Github

## Lessons Learned

I was lost so long looking for a way to shift my brain and thinking, to understand the **Object Oriented Programming** way of thinking. I have started to understand how Java objects mimic real world objects, and when you want those objects to do work you use methods. Methods as the least dry way of writing code for these objects.
Though, getting things to work and write code in this new way after just learning how to write code, that was the hardest part. I had to dig to learn what Java had to offer in it's inherited methods for Arrays and for Math. The tools are all there, I was shown how to look at them. I just had to take the time to look and understand how to best deploy them. I am worried I will not have the time to do this as projects get harder.

- Read Java Method Definitions - this (along with google) helped me find and use the Array and Math methods
- Think in Object-Oriented Programming
- Encapsulation, Object initiation, packages, StringBuilder, toString(), this, this()
- Java Fundamentals: New Knowledge of Arrays, refining (iteration and loops, while loops, and a switch statement).
- Working through the errors one by one
